                    I'm a student that really likes coding, gaming, reading and drinking shit tons of fucking tea.
                    <br>
                    <span class="p-parenthesis">( I'm drinking some as I am writing this. )</span>
                    <br>
                    I chose Computer Science Technologies CST 420.B0 as my program,
                    since I enjoy programming than that boring theory thing.
                    I still don't understand what that is.
                    <br>
                    <span class="p-parenthesis">( I am quite intellectually lacking. )</span>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, I do have some decent experience with webdev where I've been trying
                    "building" websites since I was in Secondary 5.
                    I am the embodiment of laziness, so I stop practicing and forget everything, but trust me I'm better.

                    What do you think it is?
                    Use your eyes to read and
                    understand the story that
                    the author is portraying
                    to you. I usually like to
                    read physically, although
                    since moving out of the city
                    I started reading more on my
                    phone. I usually read manga,
                    but I do like my fair share
                    of novels.
