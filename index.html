        <div class="myself-description">
                <p>
                    I'm a student that really likes coding, gaming, reading and
                    drinking shit tons of fucking tea. <br><span class="p-parenthesis">( I'm drinking some as I am
                    writing this )</span>
                    <br>
                    I chose Computer Science Technologies
                    CST 420.B0 as my program since I enjoy programming than that
                    boring theory thing, I still don't understand what that is.
                    <br><span class="p-parenthesis">( I am quite intellectually lacking )</span>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, I do have
                    some decent experience with webdev where I've been trying
                    "building" websites since I was in Secondary 5. I am the embodiment
                    of laziness, so I stop practicing and forget everything, but trust me
                    I'm better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is something I've done and am currently doing:
                </p>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>
                        Secondary 5 project:
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://4lex16.github.io/school-website/">site</a>
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4lex16/school-website/">git</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Current project for my Internet Programming course (WIP):
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://4lex16.github.io/InternetProgProject/">site</a>
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4lex16/InternetProgProject/">git</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class="hobby-name">
                <h2>Reading</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="hobby-content">

                        What do you think it is?
                        Use your eyes to read and
                        understand the story that
                        the author is portraying
                        to you. I usually like to
                        read physically, although
                        since moving out of the city
                        I started reading more on my
                        phone. I usually read manga,
                        but I do like my fair share
                        of novels.

                        A few of my favorite series are:

                    <ul class="hobby-enumeration">
                        <li>JoJo's bizarre adventure ( very gay )</li>
                        <li>Mushoku Tensei ( very weird )</li>
                        <li>Go with the Clouds, North by Northwest ( great )</li>
                        <li>Berserk ( I want to cry, must read )</li>
                    </ul>
